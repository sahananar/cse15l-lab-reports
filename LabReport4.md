# Lab Report 4

**Step 4**

Keys used: <up><enter>
  
The `ssh` command with my specific login on `ieng6` was up 1 in my search history so I clicked up to get the command for it and clicked enter. I was not prompted to enter my password as I had recently been logged in.

**Step 7**

The issue with the code is that it doesn't consider the case where both lists have overlapping elements, in that case it will end up running infinitely, which is why the second test timed out. Using the `vim` command and the insert function, I changed this part of the code.
