# Lab Report 3 - Researching Commands

## Examples using the 'grep' command

1. The 'grep -r' command, which you can use to get all of the filenames in a directory which contain a certain string as well as the lines in each file containg that specific string. For these examples, I was in the skill-demo1-data directory and written_2 was inside. 

Input 1:
```
grep -r "Italy" written_2
```
Output 1 (there were several more lines that were outputted, this screenshot shows the first few filenames)

Input 2:
```
grep -r "magnificent" written_2/travel_guides
```
Output 2 (there were several more lines that were outputted, this screenshot shows the first few filenames)
